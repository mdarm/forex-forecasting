## Overview
This is a work-in-progress of implementing ES-RNN by Slawek Smyl, winner of the M4 competition, and using it in a heuristic manner for forex-forecasting.

This repo contains:
- [x] Holt-Winters implementation.
- [x] GRU residuals learner.
- [x] Multiplicative & Additive time-series-reconstruction.
- [x] Forecasting of the forex dataset; training as well as metric results can be seen in the [outputs](outputs) folder.


## Differences between Slawek's version and this one

The original intention was to reproduce the complete ES-RNN algorithm, and its prediction results, on the entirety of the M4-competition dataset. I still have a long way to go. What I have not yet implemented, and I would certainly like to, are the following

- 3d Holt-Winters implementation (that is, multiple series processing in one step)
- multi-series-model with shared trend LSTM
- additive time-series-reconstruction
- autoregressive learner
- blender module to merge predictions from multiple series
- quantile loss to get prediction intervals
- Slawek's loss function that optimises two losses: quantile loss + regularization
```math
 L_q(y, \hat{y}) = q(y - \hat{y} )_{+} + (1- q) ( \hat{y} - y)_{+}
```
- compare performance on benchmark dataset
- reattempt the forex-forecasting

## Replicating results

To replicate the results of the es-rnn on the forex dataset: 

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:mdarm/m4-competition-approaches.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```
   cd m4-competion-approaches/es-rnn/
   ```
3. Simply run the `main.py` script.
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Dependencies

- torch
- numpy
